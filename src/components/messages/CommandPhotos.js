        I own a Fuji X-E4 and enjoy street and landscape photography. So, I've created TakeThemShots to exhibit some of my shots there.
        Cookopia is a different kind of blog mostly showing photos of food I've enjoyed üçî. Somehow food is memory and I think I can name where and who I was with in each of these photos.
