        My name is Lazaros Ioannidis and I grew up and live in Greece.

        I have studied finance and have experience in financial markets and macro-economic research. I am also a CFAÂ® charterholder.
        <br />
        <br />
        A few years ago, I moved to a data analyst role where I had the opportunity to develop my programming skills and interest in data engineering.

        I enjoy trying to figure out how to solve a problem through code and looking to deepen my understanding of computer science and software engineering.

        <br />
        I chose to study CS so as to better understand the theory and practice of modern software engineering.
        I opted for an online masters degree as it's both flexible and formal.
        Flexibility is a large benefit when you're working full-time and parenting at the same time.
        Having a formal long-term goal generally helps commit to your study plan. Hopefully.
